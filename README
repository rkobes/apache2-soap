DESCRIPTION

This is a replacement for Apache::SOAP (and SOAP::Transport::HTTP)
designed to work with the CPAN version of mod_perl 2. It is intended
as a temporary measure until the SOAP-Lite distribution
implements this functionality. Note that the provided modules
(Apache2::SOAP and SOAP::Transport::HTTP2) do not clash with
any modules of SOAP-Lite.

INSTALLATION

Installation proceeds in the usual fashion:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

The following CPAN modules will be required:

  SOAP::Lite
  mod_perl2

For Win32 (builds 8xx), ppm packages are available from ActiveState's 
default repository, http://www.bribes.org/perl/ppm/, or 
http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/.

USAGE

Usage is the same as Apache::SOAP.
